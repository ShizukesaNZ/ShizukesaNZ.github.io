# Grimoire

Grimoire is a mobile-friendly 5e spellbook that organizes spell lists by class and level.

See the latest compiled build here: [https://thebombzen.com/grimoire/](https://thebombzen.com/grimoire/)

Grimoire is forked from [ephe/grimoire](https://github.com/ephe/grimoire/), which has since been taken down (Ã  la DMCA).

## Build Instructions
I've edited _config.yml for my own build purposes, but if you've got [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) set up locally, the following should create the build from your friendly command line terminal:
`jekyll serve -Vw --no-watch --baseurl ""`
